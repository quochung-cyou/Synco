Analyze this COBOL program and extract the business logic:
Your goal: Identify WHAT the business does, not HOW the code works.{glossary_context}

## What to Extract:

### 1. Use Cases / Operations
Identify each business operation the program performs:
- CREATE / Register / Add operations
- UPDATE / Change / Modify operations  
- DELETE / Remove operations
- READ / Query / Fetch operations
- VALIDATE / Check operations
- Any other business operations
- Describe each operation as a use case.

For each use case, describe:
- What is being created/updated/deleted
- What triggers this operation
- What are the key steps

### 2. Validations as Business Rules
Extract ALL validation rules including:
- Field validations (required, format, length, range)
- Business logic validations (eligibility, authorization, state)
- Data integrity checks (duplicates, referential integrity)
- Authorization checks (user permissions, access control)
- Error codes (IDFEL) and their meanings
- Error messages (BEFEL) and conditions

### 3. Business Purpose
What business problem does this solve? (1-2 sentences)

## Format Your Response:

## Business Purpose
[1-2 sentences describing what this does for the business]

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: [Operation Name - e.g., Create Variant Family]
**Trigger:** [What initiates this operation]
**Description:** [What happens in this use case]
**Key Steps:**
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...

### Use Case 2: [Operation Name - e.g., Update Variant Family]
[Same format as above]

## Business Rules & Validations

### Data Validations
- [Field name] must be [requirement] - Error: [code/message]
- [Field name] cannot be [constraint] - Error: [code/message]

### Business Logic Rules
- [Rule description with condition] - Error: [code/message]
- [Rule description with action]

### Authorization Rules
- [Permission/access requirement]

### Data Integrity Rules
- [Referential integrity or consistency rule]

Focus on actual rules and operations found in the code. Don't invent rules that aren't there.
